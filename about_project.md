This project is mostly static at this point, as the only data that can be collected is from articles written before the election.

Make sure to install requirements.txt before running code

The three files with functions are cache_saves.py, get_site.py, and playwright_get_site.py. I would suggest running those first. 

Next, you should run get_sites.py, create_sites_df.py, data_manipulation.py, and ml_attempts.py (ml_attempts.py is not required for the finished product) in that order.

Finally, run st_analysis.py with streamlit to see the finished product
